Each difficulty has different intervals for disasters which come at random. (for example, EASY may have 150 minimum seconds before a disaster is created while NIGHTMARE has a minimum of 40 seconds, leaving you feeling hopeless. You can plant crops which costs 15 coins, water your crops, and harvest your crops which awards you 20 coins per crop harvested. In total you are making 5 coins per crop harvested or a total of 45 coins totaling all plots.
